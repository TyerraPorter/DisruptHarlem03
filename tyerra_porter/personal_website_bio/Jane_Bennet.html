<h3> Jane Bennet is the eldest of the Bennet daughters. She is the apple of her mother's eye and is the first candidate to leave the house and be married.</h3>
<h4> Jane, as the eldest, is very responsible and level headed.  She is often the one responsible for talking Elizabeth out of her heroic frenzy and guiding her sisters to have  more rational thoughts.  She, unlike Elizabeth is not opposed to the idea of marriage and soon cathches the attention of their new neighbor Mr. Bingley.
