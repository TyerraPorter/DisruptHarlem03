<h3> Elizabeth Bennet is the second of 5 daughters in the Bennet household.  Their mother's primary goal is to see that her daughters marry well by any means necessary.</h3>
<h4> Elizabeth marches to the beat of her own drum and often avoids her mother advances and inquiries with a witty remark.  She is very intelligent and strong willed which makes her her father's favorite.  She also becomes a favorite of the Mr. William Darcy, whom she later marries after a series of trying events.
