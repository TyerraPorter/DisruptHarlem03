<h1>Welcome to Disrupt Harlem Cod Squad</h1>
<p> Disrupt Harlem Code Squad is a program where youth ages 18-24 can come and expand their knowledge of technology and design.  This free,12 week program offers resources and mentorships that will set up their participants for a bright future.  Students will receive in depth instruction in three coding languages and will also gain business savy tactics so that they can ace their next interview.  Students receive a stipend at the end of each completed session and rewards along the end.  The entire session will culminate in a summit where they will pitch their app ideas to a host of developers and experts in the field. </p>
